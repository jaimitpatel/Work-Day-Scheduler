# Work-Day-Scheduler

The challenge for this week was to create a day planner which would allow any user to save data entered into local storage, and be pulled whenever you restarted the site.
The way I was able to do this was to use moment.js to current time and date.

the Acceptance Criteria for this challenge was:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
